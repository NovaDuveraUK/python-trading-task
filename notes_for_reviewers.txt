Hello!

This is fully my own work, with no use of AI or outside help at any point. 

It was an interesting task, I've learnt a lot! Especially given that I haven't used Redis before.

Here are some notes on the improvements I would make with more time:

- add pseudocode and other explanations to the code
- add status codes to APIs when the request is successful, and more meaningful success/error messages
- use a test client for both API and Redis, and add a mock database for Postgres 
- in the margin report, check if a given account hasn't been liquidated before including it in the report
- testing for correct error messages
- formatting with Black and other packages
- set up some initial mock records in Redis/Postgres so that the tests can be rewritten more cleanly, in particular already set up the cash balances on the accounts
- making separate helper functions for extracts from Redis (to change the format from bytes into text/integers/floats)
- separate helper function for margins
- finish the execute trade function
